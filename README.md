# VR Hub (Prototype)
This is the project for the VR Hub website.

## 1. Folder Structure

### 1.1 Distributables (dist)
This folder is for all production (minified) code, assets & HTML views only!

#### 1.1.1 Articles (& other HTML files)
This will be generated by Gulp, so don't worry about it!

#### 1.1.2 Assets
* CSS (Gulp will populate this folder with the minified & compressed stylesheets from your SCSS folder)
* Fonts (Gulp will populate this folder)
* Images (This is where all the JPG, PNG, GIF & SVG files should be located in)

### 1.2 Source (src)
This folder is for your localised & uncompiled CSS (Sass) & JS code.

#### 1.2.1 Data 

##### 1.2.1.1 Articles
This folder is where all the JSONs regarding article pages will be placed in.

* Author - the person who has written the article (e.g. Michael)
* Date - the date which the JSON was created (e.g. 2016-08-24 10:00:00 - preferably in a JS style format of YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)

    * Alt - the text that appears on the page if the image does not load (e.g. Colosse)
    * Title - the text that appears on hover of the image (e.g. This is an in-game screenshot of Colosse)
    * URL - the link to the image (e.g. /assets/images/articles/top-5-vr-hub-experiences/sound.png)
* Reading Time - the time it would take the user to read the full article (e.g. 3)

        * URL - the link to the image (e.g. /assets/images/articles/top-5-vr-hub-experiences/sound.png)
    * Layout - the layout partial that this object's content should be loaded into (e.g. layouts/layout003)
    * Price - the price of the app (e.g. 0 - will output 'Free')
    * Size - the size of the app (e.g. 500 - will output 500mb)
    * Text - the writeup about the app (e.g. - So you’ve got your new GearVR and your smartphone charged and ready.)
    * Title - the name of the app (Colosse)
* Slug - the name of article in a 'slugified' format (e.g. top-5-vr-hub-experiences - must match with name of Handlebars template & JSON file)
* Social - the links to the social media
    * Link - the link to be used (e.g. 'https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://samsung.com/vr-hub/articles/top-5-vr-hub-experiences')
    * Type - the social media type relating to the link (e.g. Twitter)
* Sub Header - the text to be used under the title (e.g. Now it’s time to immerse yourself. In the world of VR, content is king.)

##### 1.2.1.2 Pages
This folder is where all JSONs regarding all other pages (homepage, category pages etc) will be placed in.
Please make sure each JSON has a matching Handlebars template otherwise it won't be compiled!

#### 1.2.2 Fonts
This is where any font files will be stored but ideally, for efficiency, they'll be called via CDN.
 
#### 1.2.3 Handlebars

##### 1.2.3.1 Pages
This is where all page layout templates are to be put in (e.g. templates for the index page, for an article page, for a category page etc).

##### 1.2.3.2 Partials
This is where all modular templates are to be put in.

* Global - where all globally used & included partials (the meta tags in the head, the script tags at the bottom of the body) will be placed
* Layouts - where all the layout specific partials will be placed (see Section 3 (Partials) for more details about this folder)
 
#### 1.2.4 Images
This is where all image files will be stored.

##### 1.2.4.1 Articles
For each article you make, you'll need to make its own folder inside this Articles folder for the images to be used.

#### 1.2.5 JS
This is where all the Javascript files and code should be put in.

##### 1.2.5.1 App
This folder is for all JS files that you make.

This folder is for all 3rd party JS files, e.g. Bootstrap's JS files, jQuery etc.

#### 1.2.6 SCSS
This folder will contain all the SCSS files that be compiled into minified CSS and rendered in the Assets folder in the App directory.

* app (This is for all custom written stylesheets)
    * helpers (This is for useful code that helps maintain consistency and reduces inefficiency in the stylesheet)
        * _functions.scss (This is for functions that take in parameters and return values)
        * _mixins.scss (This is for mixins that quickly returning reusable segments of CSS code)
        * _utilities.scss (This is for any helper/reusable/misc classes)
        * _variables.scss (This is for declarations of all global variables)
    * pages (This is for any page specific code e.g homepage, contact us page etc)
    * partials (This is for any code specific to reusable partials/modules/elements e.g buttons, form elements etc)
* libraries (3rd party stylesheets - make sure to only use one CSS framework!)
    * Bootstrap (CSS framework)

## 2. Plugins
The package manager used in this project is npm & since the node_modules folder created is quite big & heavily populated, it's excluded from this repository.
So to be able to run most of the plugins needed, you'll need to install them.

### 2.1 Installation
Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), we can install all the plugins needed, using the package.json file in this repository.
To do that you must run npm in your command line by typing in `npm install` to install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file.
If this does not work, check if you have npm on your computer by typing `npm -v` & if you do not have npm installed, visit [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### 2.2 Usage
Once installation is complete, you now have a few things in your project that can making things easier to do.

#### 2.2.1 Gulp
This is the task runner for this project, compiling, concatenating & minifying all your Handlebars templates, JS & SCSS files in the Source folder and outputting the compiled files into the Assets folder in App.

##### 2.2.1.1 Requires
* browserSync (allows for live reloading on your page when code is changed)
* del (deletes files from location)
* gulp (runs the tasks)
* gulp-concat (concatenates all files piped into the task into one file)
* gulp-clean-css (minifies CSS)
* gulp-hb (Handlebars compiler for Gulp)
* gulp-htmlmin (HTML minifier)
* gulp-imagemin (image compressor)
* gulp-notify (used for outputting messages into console)
* gulp-order (allows for specific ordering of files piped into the task)
* gulp-print (outputs text in the command line)
* gulp-rename (renames files & file extensions)
* gulp-sass (compiles SASS & SCSS files into CSS)
* gulp-uglify (minifies the JS)
* imagemin-pngquant (image optmiser)
* path (accessor for path data of Gulp task pipe files)
* through2 (creates data streams)

##### 2.2.1.2 Variables
Source Paths:

* handlebarsDir (the location where all your Handlebars templates are in)
* jsApp (the location where the app JS directory can be found)
* jsLib (the location where the libraries JS directory can be found)

* scssAppFile (the location where the main SCSS file for the app SCSS directory can be found)
* scssLib (the location where the libraries SCSS directory can be found)
* scssLibFile (the location where the main SCSS file for the libraries SCSS directory can be found)

Destination Paths:

* cssDest (the location where all the compiled CSS will be placed)
* htmlDest (the location where the index HTML file will be rendered)
* jsDest (the location where all the compiled JS will be placed)

##### 2.2.1.3 Tasks
* browser_sync (reloads the site in the browser based on events)
* fonts (moves all the font files into dist)
* images (clears the images `Distributables` folder, minifies and optimises all images in the `Source` folder & then outputs that into the `Distributables` folder)
* handlebars (compiles the handlebars templates and renders HTML files)
* js_app (concatenates & minifies all custom JS written in the `Source` folder & then outputs that into the `Distributables` folder)
* js_libraries (orders all the JS files (localised jQuery file then everything else) in the Libraries directory, concatenates and minifies it all & then outputs that into the `Distributables` folder)
* scss_app (compiles the main_app.scss file & renders minified CSS from it)
* scss_libraries (compiles the main_libraries.scss file & renders minified CSS from it)
* watch (runs in the background, checking for updates of files in the Source folder & runs tasks when modifications are made - as well as kicking off BrowserSync)
