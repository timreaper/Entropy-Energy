	  "text": "Having begun entrenched in London’s underground dance scene his recordings moved into a more freeform abstract compositional structure, drawing heavily from the early electronic masters as well as his background in pirate radio. As Imaginary Forces he released on labels such as Halcyon Veil, Entr’acte, and his own label Sleep Codes. More recently he has returned to his dance music roots, finally reconciling the disparate influences that have informed his music over the years to start afresh as East Man with a new LP on Planet Mu."
