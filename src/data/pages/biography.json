	  "text": "Anthoney Hart is a London-based electronic musician. He was born in Hastings, England in 1979, but grew up on the boundary of East London and Essex, playing Drum & Bass on pirate radio in the mid nineties, most notably Rude FM. Having begun entrenched in London’s underground dance music scene his recordings moved into a more freeform abstract compositional structure, drawing heavily from the early electronic masters as well as his background in pirate radio. More recently he has returned to his dance music roots, finally reconciling the disparate influences that have informed his music over the years to start afresh with two new projects."

	  "text": "As Basic Rhythm, he draws more directly upon his pirate radio years, while still pushing forward into new territories to emerge with more overtly dancefloor material. Recorded primarily with the DJ in mind, his tracks are colourful, brutalist and adventurous contemporary hybrids, their angular rhythms drawing on Britain's dance music past, but with an eye firmly on the present."

	  "text": "As East Man his unique take on Grime reduces the sound to its steely fundamentals, bringing in influences from Dancehall, Drum & Bass and Techno to gird the voices of the MCs he works with. His own name for this hardcore continuum mongrel is ‘Hi Tek’. He has also started his own label, Hi Tek Sounds, to release his East Man productions, as well as collaborations with other musicians exploring similar musical areas."
