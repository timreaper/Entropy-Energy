	  "text": "As Imaginary Forces, his music has been released on Halcyon Veil, Entr'acte, Type Recordings and his own label, Sleep Codes. Having begun entrenched in Londonâ€™s underground dance scene his recordings moved into a more freeform abstract compositional structure, drawing heavily from the early electronic masters as well as his background in pirate radio. Recently he has returned to his dance music roots, finally reconciling the disparate influences that have informed his music over the years."
